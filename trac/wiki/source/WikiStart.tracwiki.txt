= Welcome ! =

The Urakawa SDK has moved from its previous location at [http://urakawa.sourceforge.net Sourceforge.net].

== What is the Urakawa SDK ? ==

The Urakawa SDK (Software Development Kit) is '''Free''' and '''[http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php Open-Source]''' software, released under a business-friendly licensing scheme ([http://daisy-trac.cvsdude.com/tobi/wiki/LGPLvsBSD LGPL]) that encourages commercial exploitation.

The project was initiated by the '''DAISY Consortium''', with strong support from international key partners such as the NRCD (Japan), the INRIA (France) and CWI (Netherlands).

The goal of this SDK is to minimize the development costs of complex multimedia authoring applications, by providing a robust set of APIs based on an extensible core data model. This way, the time to market multimedia editing tools can be reduced drastically, and programmers can focus on workflow and usability to add real business value to their products.

The SDK is already used by the [http://urakawa.sourceforge.net/obi Obi] application, which is a structured audio authoring tool for DAISY DTBs (Digital Talking Books).

The SDK will also make the core of [http://daisy-trac.cvsdude.com/tobi/ Tobi], which is a full-audio full-text DAISY authoring tool.

The Urakawa-SDK, Obi and Tobi are 3 software projects that are developed in close partnership within the DAISY Consortium.

'''DAISY''' (Digital Accessible Information SYstem) is an '''open standard''' for accessible electronic multimedia.

The [http://daisy.org DAISY Consortium] is a worldwide body of like-minded organizations collaborating to develop the standards and to implement strategies for the production, exchange and use of next-generation Digital Talking Books (DTB) aimed at people who are '''blind''', '''visually-impaired''', or otherwise '''print-disabled''' (e.g. dyslexic).

The DAISY Consortium is a non-profit organization.

The [http://urakawa.sf.net/ Urakawa project] is an incubator project, itself hosted under the DAISY Consortium umbrella. It currently lives at Sourceforge.net (source code SVN repository, documentation and public web-site).

The Urakawa project delivers a software stack of which the core is the SDK (Software Development Toolkit). Several applications are developed around this toolkit, the most mature being [http://urakawa.sf.net/obi Obi]. [http://daisy-trac.cvsdude.com/tobi/ Tobi] also relies on the SDK, although the software is in inception stage only.

== Current Status, Roadmap ==

The beta 1.0 release is already out. Please check [http://urakawa.sourceforge.net/sdk/Release_1.0beta.html this announcement] for details.

We are now targeting version 1.0 stable for the end of March 2008, so we are essentially working on quality assurance (unit-tests, documentation, etc.).

In preparation for the stable release, we have moved from Sourceforge.net to this online collaboration tool, called Trac. We are very exited about this upgrade and we hope the developer and user communities will like it too !

However there is a lot of content to migrate, so bare with us for a few weeks until we have properly set up this new website.

== Getting Started ==

In an effort to avoid duplication of content, we offer a link straight to the help section at the Tobi project's homepage: [http://daisy-trac.cvsdude.com/tobi/wiki/WikiStart#GettingStarted].
