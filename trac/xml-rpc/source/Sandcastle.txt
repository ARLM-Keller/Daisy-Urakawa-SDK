The following is a description of how to build the documentation for the Urakawa SDK:


== Prerequisites ==


  * Install Microsoft Sandcastle version 2.0.2459.30850 (December 2006 I think...)
  * Add the html Presentation to sandcastle:
    * Unzip the file [source:trunk/csharp/doc/PresentationHtml.zip] to the sandcastle progran directory (normally ("%!ProgramFiles%\Sandcastle")
  * Checkout the csharp implementation from the subversion repository


== Build process ==

(If you want to build documentation for the release configuration, replace debug with release in the following):

  * Build the debug(choose one or the other) configuration of the [source:trunk/csharp/coreAndTests.sln] solution
  * Open a command window and navigate to the local [source:trunk/csharp/doc] directory
  * Run {{{CopyDllsEct.bat debug}}}
  * Run {{{sandcastleBuild.bat urakawa html > sandcastleBuild.log}}}

This will create the documentation in directory [source:trunk/csharp/doc]/Output (open [source:trunk/csharp/doc]/Output/index.htm). A zipped version will be in file [source:trunk/csharp/doc/doc.zip] and corresponding dlls will be in file [source:trunk/csharp/doc/dll.zip].

== Remark ==

The above procedure for generating csharp sdk documentation is known to work with revision [1175] from the subversion repository
